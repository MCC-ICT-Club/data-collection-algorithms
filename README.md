# Data-Collection-Algorithms
This is a git repository for the creation of Image Capture Algorithms for Data Collection Systems.

Here is where I intend to familiarize myself with OpenCV by first creating my own Image Capture
program that builds of whats been shown and given in the tutorial video and series below:

My first goal when building upon the dataCollection.py program given within this video is to create
Data Collection algorithm that oscillates between different camera setting such as in brightness, 
contrast, saturation, etc. With the aim of improving my methodology around the creation of haar 
cascades for future projects.

In other repositories I'll deep dive into the actual object recognition side of things with the use
of haar cascades to become more sophisticated with my object recognition algorithms. Mixing togther
features that can detect objects, object amount, object location, distance from object, object size,
etc.

There's a huge sea of tutorials around Computer Vision that I look to dive into and use to integrate
Computer Vision into the technologies I work on.
